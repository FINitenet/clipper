CLIPper - CLIP peak enrichment recognition

A tool to detect CLIP-seq peaks.


Install:

Until the next version of scipy comes out we are stuck using rc1.  Get it here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.11.0rc1/
and install like a normal python package.

Also multiprocessing is broken in python before version 2.7.  Please make sure your python is up to date.  
Then

easy_install clipper

or 

python setup.py install

Run 

clipper -h
